# Qss Debugger
Improves the process of styling Qt applications with qss.  
Provides a hierarchical view and overlays information on your window to visualize how qss affects the layout of items.   
The compiler allows you to work comfortably by supporting features such as multi-file qss, variables and more.  
Last but not least, the file watcher updates your application style sheet automatically when files-change.
